    <string name="question_1">My phone and watch have become unpaired. How do I fix this?</string>
    <string name="answer_1">Frequently, phones and watches become unpaired due to a bug for Google WearOS. Simply reopen the WearOS app on your phone, wait until the app said "Connected via Bluetooth|Wifi" then return to your watch and re-click the listen microphone icon. A pop-up should come up that tells you that your device is reconnected.</string>

    <string name="question_2">How do I set SoundWatch to listen for sounds?</string>
    <string name="answer_2">Open the SoundWatch app in your watch and click on the microphone icon.
        That will begin listening capabilities.</string>

    <string name="question_3">My watch is not responding to touch or buttons.  How do I get it to respond?</string>
    <string name="answer_3">Your watch might be low in battery. Recharge and try again.</string>

    <string name="question_4">How do I select and deselect sounds for the watch to listen for?</string>
    <string name="answer_4">On the phone app, open SoundWatch.  You then will have a list of sounds.
    Simply uncheck the sounds you do not want the watch to listen for.
        Leave checked or recheck the sounds you want to listen for.</string>

    <string name="question_5">How do I snooze a sound on my watch?</string>
    <string name="answer_5">In the pop-up notification, there will be a button labeled “snooze”
        that you can press to snooze for a specified amount of time.  If you would like more options
        for the timing of the snooze, simply press “open” and it will display more options for you to press.</string>

    <string name="question_6">How do I see notifications if they aren’t popping up?</string>
    <string name="answer_6">If your watch is vibrating but no messages are popping up,
        you can swipe up on your watchface and the current and past notifications will display. </string>
    <string name="about_description">"SoundWatch is a smartwatch-based app that provides glanceable, always-available sound feedback.
        \nIt began on September 1st, 2018, and is led by a hard of hearing University of Washington doctoral student who wanted to build for his community. Thus, SoundWatch has involved the DHH communities at many stages of its development, along with faculty advisors, student developers, programmers, and UI/UX designers.
        \nThe project is part of the Makeability Lab at the University of Washington whose mission is to “design, build and study interactive tools and techniques to address pressing societal challenges.” Sponsored by the National Science Foundation, SoundWatch app is freely available and the code is open-sourced for anyone wanting to learn more and contribute to its development.
        \n\nThank you for using SoundWatch!
        \nThis is a beta release, so always feel free to connect with us to provide feedback so we can improve or to just say Hi!
